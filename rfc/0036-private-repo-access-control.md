# RFC: Default Private Repository Access by Explicit Access List Only

This RFC proposes that repositories in Open Device Partnership (ODP) that are marked as **private** should be invisible
and inaccessible to ODP organization members by default unless those members are explicitly granted access through an
approved team or direct repository permission.

## Change Log

- 2026-06-08: Initial RFC draft created.
- 2026-06-11: Addressed review feedback — explicit org admin visibility, required team-based access, 6-month audit
  evidence, private-to-public intent and transition checklist.

## Motivation

ODP has both public and private repositories. Private repositories are often used for early-stage, partner-sensitive, or
pre-disclosure work that should not be broadly visible. Today, all ODP organization members can see all private
repositories by default, which weakens confidentiality controls and makes "private" less predictable in practice.

This RFC applies a least-privilege model to private repositories:

- Being a member of ODP should **not** by itself imply visibility into private repositories.
- Access to a private repository should be intentional, reviewable, and auditable.
- Repository owners should be able to keep early-stage work, partner-sensitive material, and limited-distribution
  discussions private without relying on informal expectations.

## Technology Background

ODP uses GitHub for governance and repository management. Access is controlled through organization membership, teams,
and repository-level grants.

Today, ODP grants members default read access to private repositories through an organization-wide base permission. This
RFC changes that model so private repository access is granted only through explicit allowlists:

- approved GitHub teams mapped to a repository, or
- explicit repository collaborator grants where justified.

## Goals

The goals of this RFC are:

1. Ensure private repositories are visible only to explicitly authorized users.
2. Reduce accidental overexposure of pre-release, partner-sensitive, or incubation work.
3. Improve auditability of who has access to sensitive repositories.
4. Encourage repository owners to make an intentional visibility choice:
   - **Public** when broad collaboration is desired.
   - **Private** when access should be tightly controlled.

## Requirements

The following requirements define the proposed policy:

1. **No implied access from ODP membership alone**  
   Membership in the ODP GitHub organization must not, by itself, grant visibility into or access to any private
   repository. ODP GitHub organization owners (admins) retain full visibility and access to all repositories, including
   private repositories, as this is inherent to the GitHub platform administration role.

2. **Explicit authorization required**  
   A user must be explicitly granted access to a private repository through one of the following:
   - Add to a GitHub team that has been granted permissions to that repository (preferred).
3. **Default deny for private repositories**  
   Private repositories must default to a deny-by-default posture. No broad organization-wide read access should be
   assumed or inherited for private repositories. At the GitHub organization level, base access must be configured so
   private repository visibility is not granted through membership alone.

4. **Team-based access required by default**  
   Team-based access is the required model for maintainability and auditability. Users should be added to an appropriate
   team rather than granted individual access.

5. **6-month access audit**  
   Owners or designated maintainers of a private repository must review its access list at least every six months and
   remove stale or unnecessary access.

6. **Audit evidence and record-keeping**  
   Each 6-month access review must produce a permanent, verifiable record confirming the audit was performed. Acceptable
   evidence includes a dated issue or pull request in the repository, or a signed-off audit log. ODP should provide an
   automated mechanism (for example, a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow) that reminds repository owners when a review
   is due and tracks completion.

7. **Exceptions must be explicit**  
   Any broad-access exception for private repositories (for example, the cargo vet auditor team needing cross-repository
   visibility, or security and release administration scenarios) must be explicitly documented and approved by the
   Steering Committee or a formally delegated operations group. Each exception must record owner, scope, justification,
   and review date.

8. **Private means not discoverable within ODP unless authorized**  
   For ODP governance purposes, a private repository should be treated as not visible to other ODP members unless they
   are on the approved access list.

9. **ODP platform and framework code must be contributed upstream**  
   Any ODP platform or framework code developed within a private repository — including partner collaboration
   repositories — must be contributed back upstream to a public ODP repository. Private repositories containing partner
   intellectual property may remain private when justified, but they must not become the sole home for reusable ODP
   platform or framework work. In all cases, private repositories must still comply with all other requirements in this
   RFC (team-based access, 6-month audits, etc.).

## Proposed Policy

ODP adopts the following repository access policy:

- **Public** repositories are intended for broad visibility and contribution.
- **Private** repositories are intended to be visible only to explicitly authorized users. Partner collaboration
  repositories containing partner IP may remain private when justified, but any ODP platform or framework code in those
  repositories must be contributed back upstream to a public ODP repository.
- ODP organization membership alone is insufficient to view or access a private repository.
- ODP GitHub organization owners (admins) retain full visibility to all repositories as part of their platform
  administration role.

The **Requirements** section is normative and applies to all private repositories upon ratification of this RFC.

## Unresolved Questions

The following questions should be resolved during RFC review:

### Resolved

1. Should there be a small number of standing exception teams (for example, security or release administration), and if
   so, how are those exceptions governed?
   - Yes. Exceptions are addressed in Requirement 7 with explicit documentation and Steering Committee approval.
2. What evidence should repository owners retain to show six-month access recertification was completed?
   - Addressed in Requirement 6. Acceptable evidence includes a dated issue, pull request, or signed-off audit log, with
     an automated reminder mechanism.
3. Should direct collaborator grants on private repositories require additional justification or expiration?
   - Direct grants now require documented justification (Requirement 2 and 4). Team-based access is required by default.
4. Should ODP also define guidance for when work should move from private to public?
   - Yes. Requirement 9 establishes that private repos should have a path to public, and a transition checklist is
     provided in the Adoption Strategy.

### Open

1. Should private repositories containing partner IP have a maximum retention period (for example, 12 or 24 months),
   after which the repository must be deleted or transferred out of the ODP organization?

2. **Repeatable access audit record format**: Should each private repository be required to maintain a structured
   `ACCESS-AUDIT.md` file committed directly to the repository as the canonical audit record? A proposed format would
   include:
   - A table of authorized teams and their permission levels, with grant date and justification.
   - A table of any individual (direct collaborator) grants with justification and optional expiry date.
   - An audit history table with one row per completed 6-month review, recording the review date, the auditor (GitHub
     username), a summary of changes made, and a sign-off.

   Example `ACCESS-AUDIT.md` structure:

   ```markdown
   # Access Audit Log

   ## Authorized Access

   ### Teams

   | Team                             | Permission Level | Granted Date | Justification |
   | -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
   | @OpenDevicePartnership/team-name | Write            | YYYY-MM-DD   | Reason        |

   ### Individual Grants (exceptions — require justification)

   | GitHub Username | Permission Level | Granted Date | Justification | Expiry            |
   | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
   | @username       | Read             | YYYY-MM-DD   | Reason        | YYYY-MM-DD or N/A |

   ## Audit History

   | Review Date | Auditor   | Changes Made                      | Sign-off             |
   | ----------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- |
   | YYYY-MM-DD  | @username | None / Removed @user, added @team | @username YYYY-MM-DD |
   ```

   An automated GitHub Actions workflow would run on a schedule every 6 months, check whether `ACCESS-AUDIT.md` has been
   updated within the required period, and if overdue, open a GitHub issue in the repository and assign it to the
   repository owner to prompt the audit review.

   Example workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: Access Audit Reminder

   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: "0 9 1 */6 *" # 9am UTC on the 1st of every 6th month
     workflow_dispatch:

   permissions:
     issues: write
     contents: read

   jobs:
     check-audit:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4

         - name: Check ACCESS-AUDIT.md last updated date
           id: check
           run: |
             if [ ! -f ACCESS-AUDIT.md ]; then
               echo "missing=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
             else
               LAST=$(git log -1 --format="%ct" -- ACCESS-AUDIT.md)
               NOW=$(date +%s)
               DAYS=$(( (NOW - LAST) / 86400 ))
               if [ "$DAYS" -gt 183 ]; then
                 echo "overdue=true" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
                 echo "days=$DAYS" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
               fi
             fi

         - name: Get repo owner
           id: owner
           if: steps.check.outputs.overdue == 'true' || steps.check.outputs.missing == 'true'
           run: |
             OWNER=$(gh api repos/${{ github.repository }} --jq '.owner.login')
             echo "login=$OWNER" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
           env:
             GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

         - name: Create audit issue
           if: steps.check.outputs.overdue == 'true' || steps.check.outputs.missing == 'true'
           run: |

## Prior Art

Common open-source governance practice distinguishes between broadly collaborative repositories and repositories
intended for limited visibility. ODP already uses governance documentation and an RFC process to formalize
organization-level policy decisions. This proposal extends that governance style to repository access control by making
the default behavior for private repositories explicit and predictable.

Within ODP itself, the repository set already includes both public and private repositories, which reinforces the need
for a clear policy about what "private" operationally means for maintainers and contributors.

## Alternatives

### Alternative 1: Make all ODP members able to see all private repositories (current behavior)

This is the current default in ODP. While it maximizes discoverability inside the organization, it weakens
least-privilege controls and makes "private" less meaningful for sensitive or early-stage work. In practice, this is
especially problematic for repositories that contain work related to unreleased hardware or that support early
engagement with partners under confidentiality constraints. In those cases, broad visibility to all ODP members risks
exposing pre-disclosure material to people who are not part of the relevant workstream, undermining the trust model that
partners and hardware vendors expect.

### Alternative 2: Create a separate GitHub organization for partner engagement

A separate GitHub organization could be used to host private repositories intended for partner engagement and
pre-release hardware work, keeping them fully isolated from the main ODP organization. However, maintaining a second
GitHub organization is expensive in terms of licensing costs and introduces a significant maintenance burden. Teams,
permissions, CI/CD integrations, and governance policies would need to be duplicated and kept in sync across both
organizations. Contributors working across both organizations would face additional friction, and the split would
fragment project history and tooling. The cost and operational complexity outweigh the benefits when the same isolation
can be achieved through explicit access controls within a single organization.

## Rust Code Design

Not applicable.

## Guide-Level Explanation

Contributors:

- Use **public** when broad collaboration and discoverability are intended.
- Use **private** when access should be intentionally restricted.
- Do not assume ODP membership implies private repository access.
- Request private repository access through the appropriate team or explicit repository permission.

Repository owners:

- Choose private only when restricted visibility is intended.
- Maintain a deliberate access list.
- Prefer team-based permissions over individual additions.
- Periodically confirm that each person or team still needs access.

## Adoption Strategy

This policy applies to all private repositories upon RFC ratification. The rollout below defines remediation and
verification steps:

1. Configure organization settings immediately so membership alone does not grant private repository visibility.
2. Inventory existing private repositories in ODP.
3. Review current access grants for those repositories.
4. Remove broad or stale access that does not align with the new policy.
5. Document any approved exception cases.
6. Set up a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow (or equivalent automation) to remind repository owners of 6-month access
   reviews and track audit completion.

### Private-to-Public Transition Checklist

When transitioning a repository from private to public, the repository owner must complete the following before changing
visibility:

1. Review the full git history for secrets, tokens, API keys, or credentials and remove them (consider using tools such
   as `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner).
2. Review the full git history for partner-sensitive, pre-disclosure, or personally identifiable information and remove
   it.
3. Ensure all dependencies are compatible with public distribution and licensing requirements.
4. Confirm the repository license is correct and visible.
5. Review and update the README and CODEOWNERS for public-facing context.
6. Remove or redact any internal-only documentation, links, or references.
7. Obtain sign-off from the repository owner or designated maintainer that the scrub is complete.

Completion criteria:

1. All private repositories have an explicit team-based or justified direct access model.
2. Organization-wide membership does not grant private repository visibility by default.
3. Approved exceptions are documented with owner, scope, justification, and review date.

## Drawbacks

This policy increases administrative overhead for repository owners and may slow down access for contributors who need
to join a private workstream. It also reduces incidental discoverability of work inside ODP. Those tradeoffs are
intentional and are the cost of a clearer least-privilege posture for private repositories.
